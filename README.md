STM32 Serial Port GUI
This project is a graphical user interface (GUI) for communicating with an STM32 microcontroller via a serial port. It extends the functionality of STM32-Serial-Port.

The GUI is developed in C++ using Microsoft Visual Studio.

Features
ðŸ“¡ Serial Port Communication â€“ Connects and communicates with STM32 via UART.
ðŸ–¼ Image Transfer â€“ Sends images to STM32 for display on an ePaper screen.
ðŸ–¥ Data Visualization â€“ Displays received data, including raw bitmaps from STM32.
ðŸŽ› User Controls:
Send Image 1 â€“ Sends the "Cat" image.
Send Image 2 â€“ Sends the "Testowy Test" image.
Receive â€“ Retrieves and displays the current raw bitmap.
Connect â€“ Opens and connects to the serial port.
Disconnect â€“ Closes the serial port.
Microcontroller Setup
The STM32 firmware supports communication via UART and updates the OLED display based on the current operation (sending/receiving data).

Technologies Used
